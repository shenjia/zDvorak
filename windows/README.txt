Dverty is a regular US Dvorak keyboard layout but toggles to Qwerty while the Ctrl button is held down.

Keyboard shortcuts are always designed with Qwerty layouts in mind.  Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste can all be done in Qwerty with one hand, but not in Dvorak.  Dverty solves this problem.

Dverty has only been tested on Windows XP, Vista, and Vista x64 systems.  Use at your own risk.
